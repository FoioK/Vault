 * The transaction status is filled with codes of the ISO 20022 data table. Only the codes RCVD, PATC, ACTC, ACWC and RJCT are used: - 'ACSP': 'AcceptedSettlementInProcess' -    All preceding checks such as technical validation and customer profile were successful and therefore the payment initiation has been accepted for execution. - 'ACTC': 'AcceptedTechnicalValidation' -    Authentication and syntactical and semantical validation are successful. - 'ACWC': 'AcceptedWithChange' -    Instruction is accepted but a change will be made, such as date or remittance not sent. - 'RCVD': 'Received' -    Payment initiation has been received by the receiving agent. - 'RJCT': 'Rejected' -    Payment initiation or individual transaction included in the payment initiation has been rejected.
